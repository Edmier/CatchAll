# CatchAll

Simple bot that creates a catch all channel for hacked accounts

Messages containing a link will result in the user being banned, without is a 12 hour timeout. Everything is logged.

You are free to rename channels and delete the default message and send your own. But the channels have to be created by the bot for now, you can't chose your own to use.
If a channel is deleted just run /setup again.
